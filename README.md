# Number-Guessing-Game-FreeCodeCamp
This one of the required projects to earn Relational Database certification from FreeCodeCamp.

The script that generates a random number between 1 and 1000, prompts the user to enter their username, and lets them guess the number. The script should provide feedback indicating if the guess is too high, too low, or correct, and should repeat until the correct number is guessed. It should also keep track of the number of guesses taken. Finally, the script should connect to a database to save the username, number of guesses, and total games played.
